# Weight Unit Consistency Fix

## Problem Description

The weight display was showing incorrect values due to unit conversion issues between the ESP32 hardware, Raspberry Pi server, and database storage.

**Example of the Issue:**
- ESP32 sends: `üì¶ Final Weight: 3351.58 g`
- Database was storing: `3351580.0g` (incorrect - 1000x too large)
- Should store and display: `3351.58 g`

## Root Cause

The issue was in the MQTT message parsing in `server.py`:

1. **ESP32 Hardware**: Sends weight in grams (e.g., `Final Weight: 3351.58 g`)
2. **Server Parsing**: Extracted the numeric value `3351.58` and stored it directly
3. **Database Storage**: System assumes weights are stored in kilograms
4. **Display Conversion**: Code multiplied by 1000 to convert "kg to grams": `3351.58 * 1000 = 3351580.0`

The problem was that the extracted weight from ESP32 was already in grams, but the system expected it to be in kg.

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Weight Parsing in `server.py`

**Before (Line 149-152):**
```python
weight_match = re.search(r'Final Weight:\s*([0-9]+\.?[0-9]*)', message)
if weight_match:
    weight = float(weight_match.group(1))  # This was in grams
    logger.info(f"LOADCELL: Parsed formatted weight: {weight}g from message: {message}")
```

**After:**
```python
weight_match = re.search(r'Final Weight:\s*([0-9]+\.?[0-9]*)', message)
if weight_match:
    weight_grams = float(weight_match.group(1))
    weight = weight_grams / 1000  # Convert grams to kg for consistent storage
    logger.info(f"LOADCELL: Parsed formatted weight: {weight_grams}g ({weight}kg) from message: {message}")
```

### Data Flow After Fix

```
ESP32 Hardware    ‚Üí    Server Parsing    ‚Üí    Database Storage    ‚Üí    Display
   3351.58 g      ‚Üí      3.35158 kg       ‚Üí      3.35158 kg        ‚Üí    3351.58 g
   (actual)       ‚Üí      (converted)      ‚Üí      (stored)          ‚Üí    (displayed)
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ESP32: `Final Weight: 3351.58 g`
- Display: `üìä Weight captured: 3351580.0g` ‚ùå

### After Fix
- ESP32: `Final Weight: 3351.58 g`  
- Display: `üìä Weight captured: 3351.6g` ‚úÖ

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **ESP32 Weight Message**: Check ESP32 sends `Final Weight: X.X g`
2. **Server Log**: Look for `LOADCELL: Parsed formatted weight: X.Xg (Y.Ykg)`
3. **Database Value**: Weight should be stored as kg (small decimal value)
4. **Display**: Should show original gram value from ESP32

## Files Modified

- `backend/server.py` - Fixed weight parsing and unit conversion
- `backend/WEIGHT_UNIT_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Related Issues

This fix resolves the weight unit inconsistency and complements the existing frontend weight display fix documented in `WEIGHT_DISPLAY_FIX.md`.

The system now maintains consistent units:
- **ESP32**: Measures and sends in grams
- **Database**: Stores in kilograms  
- **Frontend**: Displays in grams (converted from kg)

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check database values (should be in kg - small decimals)
sqlite3 database.db "SELECT weight FROM loaded_sensor_data ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Monitor server logs for correct parsing
tail -f app.log | grep "LOADCELL: Parsed formatted weight"

# Check frontend display (should match ESP32 original values)
# View the Scanner page in the web interface
```
