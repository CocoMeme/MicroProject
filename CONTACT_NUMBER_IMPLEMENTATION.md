# Contact Number Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added contact number support for products and orders throughout the system, including database storage, receipt printing, and frontend display.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Database Schema Update (`backend/app.py`)
- **Orders Table**: Added `contact_number` field to store customer contact information
- **Migration Function**: Created `migrate_database()` to add contact_number column to existing orders table
- **New Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      order_number TEXT NOT NULL,
      customer_name TEXT NOT NULL,
      email TEXT NOT NULL,
      contact_number TEXT NOT NULL,  -- NEW FIELD
      address TEXT NOT NULL,
      product_id TEXT NOT NULL,
      product_name TEXT NOT NULL,
      amount REAL NOT NULL,
      date TEXT NOT NULL,
      status TEXT NOT NULL
  )
  ```

#### 2. API Endpoint Updates (`backend/app.py`)
- **Order Creation**: Updated `create_order()` endpoint to require and store contact numbers
- **Print API**: Modified `print_qr_code()` to include contact number in printer data
- **Required Fields**: Added `contactNumber` to required fields validation

#### 3. Product Data Enhancement (`backend/products_data.py`)
- Added `contact_number: "+63 912 345 6789"` to all products for support contact
- This provides customers with direct support contact for each product

#### 4. Receipt Printing Updates (`backend/print.py`)
- **Customer Contact**: Added customer contact number to receipts
- **Support Contact**: Added support contact information at bottom of receipts
- **Layout Adjustments**: Updated height calculations to accommodate new fields
- **Receipt Format**:
  ```
  Order-id: ORD-XXX
  Customer: John Doe
  Email: john@example.com
  Contact: +63 912 345 6789  -- NEW
  Address: Customer Address
  
  Product: Product Name
  Amount: â‚±999.00
  
  Date: 2025-07-16
  Support: +63 912 345 6789  -- NEW

  ```

### Frontend Changes

#### 5. Order Form Updates (`frontend/src/pages/Products.js`)
- **Form State**: Added `contactNumber` to form data state
- **Input Field**: Added required contact number input with placeholder
- **Validation**: Contact number is now required for order submission
- **Form Layout**: Positioned contact field between email and address for logical flow

#### 6. Orders Display (`frontend/src/pages/Orders.js`)
- **Table Header**: Added "Contact" column to orders table
- **Data Display**: Shows customer contact numbers with fallback to "N/A" for legacy orders
- **Responsive Layout**: Maintained table responsiveness with additional column

#### 7. Product Display Enhancement (`frontend/src/pages/Products.js`)
- **Support Info**: Added support contact number display on each product card
- **Customer Experience**: Customers can see support contact before purchasing

## Contact Numbers Used
- **Customer Support**: +63 912 345 6789 (displayed on products and receipts)
- **Customer Contact**: User-provided during order creation

## Database Migration
- Automatic migration runs on application startup
- Existing orders will have contact_number set to "N/A" as default
- New orders require valid contact number

## Benefits
1. **Improved Customer Service**: Direct contact information for support
2. **Better Order Management**: Complete customer contact details stored
3. **Enhanced Receipts**: Both customer and support contacts printed
4. **Professional Appearance**: Contact information readily available

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing orders without contact numbers display "N/A"
- Migration handles database schema changes automatically
- No data loss during upgrade

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test order creation with contact number field
2. Verify contact number appears in orders table
3. Check receipt printing includes both contact numbers
4. Confirm product support information displays correctly
5. Test database migration with existing data
