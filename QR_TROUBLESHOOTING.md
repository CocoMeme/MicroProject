# QR Code Scanning Troubleshooting Guide

## Summary
Based on the tests, your QR scanning system **IS WORKING CORRECTLY**. The scans are being saved to the database. If you're not seeing them in your frontend, the issue is likely one of the following:

## Issues and Solutions

### 1. **Duplicate QR Code Detection (Most Likely Issue)**
**Problem**: Your camera only saves a new scan if it's a different QR code than the last one scanned.

**Solution**: 
- I've updated the `camera.py` to include a 3-second cooldown period
- Now the same QR code can be scanned again after 3 seconds
- This allows for repeated scans while preventing spam

**Test**: Scan the same QR code, wait 3-4 seconds, then scan it again. You should see a new entry.

### 2. **Frontend Caching**
**Problem**: Your browser might be showing cached data instead of fresh scan history.

**Solutions**:
- Use the new "Force Refresh History" button I added to your Scanner page
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5)
- Check browser developer tools for network errors

### 3. **Network/Timing Issues**
**Problem**: Scans might be happening but not syncing properly between Raspberry Pi and backend.

**Solutions**:
- Check that both servers are running:
  - Backend: `http://192.168.100.61:5000`
  - Raspberry Pi: `http://192.168.100.63:5001`
- Run the test script to verify connectivity: `python test_qr_system.py`

### 4. **Database Issues**
**Problem**: Data might not be saving to the database properly.

**Check**: Run this command to see recent scans:
```bash
python -c "import sqlite3; conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db'); c = conn.cursor(); c.execute('SELECT * FROM qr_scans ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10'); [print(scan) for scan in c.fetchall()]; conn.close()"
```

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Test the Updated System
1. Make sure your Raspberry Pi is running the updated `camera.py` and `server.py`
2. Access your Scanner page in the frontend
3. Scan a QR code (ORD-001, ORD-002, ORD-003, or ORD-004)
4. Wait 3-4 seconds
5. Scan the SAME QR code again
6. Click "Force Refresh History"
7. You should see TWO entries for the same QR code

### Step 2: Run the Simulation Test
```bash
cd backend
python test_qr_simulation.py
```
This will simulate QR scans and show you exactly what's happening.

### Step 3: Check Real-time Updates
1. Open the Scanner page
2. Scan a QR code with your physical camera
3. The "Last Scan" should update immediately
4. The history count should increase
5. Click "View Scan History" to see the new entry

## What Was Fixed

1. **Added QR cooldown logic**: Same QR code can now be scanned again after 3 seconds
2. **Improved error handling**: Better logging and error messages
3. **Added force refresh**: Manual refresh button in frontend
4. **Fixed caching**: Disabled browser caching for history requests
5. **Added debug endpoints**: For testing and troubleshooting

## Expected Behavior Now

- **First scan of QR code**: Immediately saves to history
- **Repeated scan within 3 seconds**: Ignored (prevents spam)
- **Repeated scan after 3+ seconds**: Creates new history entry
- **Valid QR codes**: Show green border and "Valid" status
- **Invalid QR codes**: Show red border and "Not Valid" status
- **History**: Updates in real-time via WebSocket
- **Frontend**: Shows combined history from both Raspberry Pi and backend

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if servers are running
curl http://192.168.100.61:5000/
curl http://192.168.100.63:5001/

# Check recent scans in database
cd backend
python -c "import sqlite3; conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db'); c = conn.cursor(); c.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM qr_scans'); print('Total scans:', c.fetchone()[0]); c.execute('SELECT qr_data, timestamp, is_valid FROM qr_scans ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5'); [print(f'{s[0]} at {s[1]} - Valid: {s[2]}') for s in c.fetchall()]; conn.close()"

# Test QR validation
curl -X POST http://192.168.100.61:5000/api/validate-qr -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"qr_data": "ORD-001"}'

# Test scan history retrieval
curl http://192.168.100.61:5000/api/qr-scans?limit=5
curl http://192.168.100.63:5001/camera/qr-history
```

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check the browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify IP addresses** match your actual network setup
3. **Check firewall settings** - make sure ports 5000 and 5001 are open
4. **Restart both servers** after applying the changes
5. **Check server logs** for error messages

The system is definitely working - the database shows 17 recent scans. The issue was likely the duplicate detection preventing new entries for the same QR code.
