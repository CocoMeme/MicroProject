I want to create a full-stack project for my Parcel Sorting Machine using Raspberry Pi 5 and ESP32. 

Please generate the folder structure and setup commands to initialize:
- A Flask backend using Python in a folder called `backend`
- A React frontend in a folder called `frontend`

I'm using Windows for development. I want you to:
1. Set up the backend with a virtual environment and Flask installed.
2. Set up the frontend with React using Create React App (or Vite if you prefer).
3. Create a `.gitignore` file for both folders.
4. Prepare basic `README.md` files for each folder.

Don't include any UI or API code yet â€” I just want to scaffold the workspace cleanly.
